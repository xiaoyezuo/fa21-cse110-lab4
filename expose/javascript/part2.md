1. Line 12 will output the length of input prices array which is 3. Since i has a function scope, we are able to access it anywhere inside the function.
2. Line 13 will output the value of discountedPrice for the last element in the prices array, which is 150 in this case. Since discountedPrice is declared using the var keyword, it can be accessed anywhere inside the function.
3. Line 14 will output 150, which is the rounded discounted price for the last element in the prices array. Since it's declared using the var keyword, it can be accessed anywhere inside the function.
4. This function will return the discounted array because discounted is declared using the var keyword and thus is accessible anywhere within the function.
5. The code will return an error. Since variable i is declared using the let keyword, it's only accessible within the for loop block.
6. The code will return an error. Since variable discountedPrice is declared using the let keyword, it's only accessible within the for loop block.
7. The code will output the value of variable finalPrice because it's defined using the let keyword within the function scope.
8. This function will return the discounted array variable because it's defined using the let keyword within the function scope.
9. The code will cause an error because i is defined using keyword let within the scope of the for loop. Thus, i is not accessible outside of the loop.
10. Line 12 will print out the length variable to the console since it's defined within the scope of the function using keyword const.
11. The function will return the discounted array with three discounted prices populated. This is because when we're adding to an array or object we're not re-declaring the array but only adding values to the list the constant pointer points to.
